I have done different paid travel jobs in my 2 years of travel and so many work trade jobs where I volunteered and got free accommodation and free food!

•Worldpackers - This is my favorite option! I have
done 5 jobs from them so far. you work anywhere in the world in exchange for a free place to stay and often free food. they have thousands of jobs from surf instructor, hostel receptionist, working on fruit farms, nannying, taking care of animals and so much more, they have the most job options. you get to live with locals which is so cool to be immersed in the culture.

•Freelance work - i was a social media manager for a travel company. I worked from my phone part time. It was nice I had so much freedom to travel and work remotely!
there are so many ways you can travel when you are young and broke. i spend less money traveling than i would if i was renting in the US. oftentimes i am living for free WHILE traveling which takes away my biggest expense!!
