Last week’s news article says why Vietnam, Bali and Thailand is preferred now over Goa. 

@business_today article talks about a twitter thread where people are discussing “Go to Bali/Hanoi/Phuket only. Been there 3 times this year. And one time to Goa. Goa was 2.5x costlier, filthier, and most importantly, didn’t feel good after spending so much money for the family. Compared to this, Vietnam Nha Trang was so much better. Goa has lost it,”
