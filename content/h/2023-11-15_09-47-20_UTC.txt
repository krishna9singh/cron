Story behind ;) ‚¨áÔ∏è
Earlier I received a lot of requests for portrait commissions but I always denied saying  I don't do acrylic portraits (with a lot of thoughts inside -what if my customer gets disappointed with my work,what if it won't come out exact , what if I couldn't complete it on time ,etc etc) It was just the fear inside me that was not allowing me to leave my comfort zone.
.
.
But this time my customer believed in me and said "muje pta hai tum kar logi, try it atleast " and that was the moment I finally took the courage to jump out of my comfort zone to try something new and guess what it became my new comfort zone.  FINAL result was so satisfying .ü§ç

TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN ME- 
These small gestures means a lot
Thankyou so muchü§çü§ç
