Sri Lanka is a beautiful country. It offers amazing wildlife, beautiful nature but also very nice beaches and coastline. I traveled through many places and explored a lot of things but here is my TOP 8 you can't miss:

1. Be in the clouds on Ambulawawa Tower - the entrance fee is INR 530/- per person and view is so worth it!
You can get there from Kandy by train, taxi or tuktuk :)

2.Watching elephants in Pinnawala - The entrance fee is INR 800/- It's the Orphanage of elephants and you can also feed them and watch them bathing in the river.

3.)Travel from Kandy to Ella by train - Don't forget to buy tickets with reserved seats in 2nd or 3rd class in advance (online or in person at Kandy station.

4.)Watch sunrise on Pidurangala Rock - entrance fee 260/-rs per person and it takes only 20 minutes to get to the topIt's also in Sigiriya on the opposite side of Lion's Rock. If you don't want to pay 15$ (INR 1,200/-)entrance fee for Lion's Rock go to Pidurangala instead. It offers better views
