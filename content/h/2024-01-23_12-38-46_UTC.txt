I just figured out something about the jams we usually eat. They’re not as healthy as I thought. Turns out, some are loaded with too much sugar, colors, and preservatives that aren’t good for our health.(These are considered safe so yes these products are safe but I personally prefer having the Natural options with less artificial additives)Instead of enjoying the natural goodness of fruits, we’re getting a bunch of not-so-good stuff.

Some Non-sponsored Good options are Orchard Lane,Eatopia,Bhuira Jams etc 
Or you can make it at home but use dates or jaggery instead of refined sugar.
