Burgerüçî

This is a comparison video between a burger I bought from McDonald‚Äôs and a burger I bought from a local Chinese van. The Mc Aloo Tikki burger costed me 50 rupees while the local veg burger costed me 40 rupees. Surprisingly both these burgers were great and unique in their own way. I had a great experience trying out both these burgers. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
