Nine Arches Bridge,Sri Lanka🇱🇰

The Nine Arch Bridge, also known as the ‘Bridge in the Sky’ was constructed by connecting two bog mountains when constructing the Badulla – Colombo railway. This bridge is 300 feet in length, 25 feet in width and 80-100 feet in height. It is one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The Bridge can be reached by travelling 2km on Gotuwala road starting from Halpe Textile centre in Badulla Bandarawela road. The surrounding area has seen a steady increase in tourism due to the bridge’s architectural ingenuity and the profuse greenery in the nearby hillsides.
