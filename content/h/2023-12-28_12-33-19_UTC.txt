I was thinking if those soda drinks with cumin and lemon are good or not But when I considered adding soda, sugar, color, flavor, and preservatives to make them tastier, I figured they might not be any better than regular cold drinks. Even with cumin and lemon, these sodas could be just as bad. So go for homemade lemonade, cumin drink, or Shikanji – they seem like a healthier and tastier choice.
