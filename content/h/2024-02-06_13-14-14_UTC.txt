Places like Hagiang I felt was a bit unsafe. And facilities are not top notch in some places. So be ready to adjust if you love to travel local. 100% worth it but 🙂

Also if you love to design your own clothes, Vietnam is a dream destination for that. You can even make same to same copy of fashion you see online within 24 hours.
