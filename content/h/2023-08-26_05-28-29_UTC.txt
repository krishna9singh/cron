Here are the three worst breakfast foods that you should stop eating today:

1. Bread - White breads are made from refined flour which isn’t great for digestion. People often opt for Multigrain, whole wheat, and brown bread, but even these might contain refined flour.

2.Packed Fruit Juices - Some people prefer fruit juices for breakfast, thinking they are rich in micronutrients. However, many packed fruit juices are full of sugar and lack actual fruit content or nutrients.

3. Cereals - While cereals are considered healthy, in India, about 95% of cereals have high sugar and low fiber content. These sugar-loaded cereals contribute to weight gain.

Instead, go for healthier options like roti instead of bread, whole fruits instead of packed fruit juices, and consider choosing @ketofy.in muesli over sugary cereals. This muesli is low in calories, high in dietary fiber and protein, and has no added sugar. It’s a convenient and healthy choice for a busy lifestyle.
