This is an easy breakfast recipe of vegetarian soya kebabs, made using very few ingredients, including besan, soya, vegetables and a few spices. It is a very healthy and high protein breakfast option and I paired it with a glass of fresh fruit juice. I had a great experience trying out this new breakfast recipe. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
