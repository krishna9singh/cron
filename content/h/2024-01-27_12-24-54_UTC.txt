I’ve noticed that several peanut butter brands use hydrogenated vegetable fats to enhance texture, but it’s not great for our heart health. The plus side for brands is that it’s affordable, so major companies incorporate it into their peanut butter.

Let’s take a closer look at a few brands:

	1.	Sundrop Peanut Butter: They’ve added hydrogenated vegetable fat without specifying which one, and they’ve also included refined oil.
	2.	Saffola Peanut Butter: I appreciate that they’ve used jaggery instead of refined sugar, but I’m puzzled why they included hydrogenated soybean oil.
	3.	Kissan Peanut Butter: This one contains hydrogenated palm oil.
	4.	Skippy and Healthy Hunger: These brands seem to go all-in with three types of hydrogenated vegetable fats.
	5.	Max Protein: It’s got hydrogenated soybean oil in the mix.
	6.	Dr. Oetker: Even though it doesn’t have hydrogenated fat, it still has Vegetable fat.

If you know of any other peanut butter brands that people should be aware of, please share in the comments to help others make healthier choices.
