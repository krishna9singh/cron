Yes, it is indeed safe to visit Kashmir any time of the year as this is a common concern for every tourist visiting the valley, the tourists are never harmed in this region, the media is biased when it comes to the valley. The issue is political and has nothing to do with tourists.

Save and share it with your friends😉
