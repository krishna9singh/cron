Unlike most other temples in Ancient Egypt, Luxor Temple isn’t dedicated to a specific god or pharaoh. Instead, it’s dedicated to the “rejuvenation of kingship”. It’s likely that this is where most of the great pharaohs were coronated. Egyptians believed that Amun, the God of Air, experienced a ‘rebirth’ with each new Pharoah. This took place at an annual reenacted coronation ceremony.

It was also an important resting place for the pharaohs, with many buried in the tombs here.

Story of the Luxor Temple⬇️

Dating back to 1392 BCE, the temple was built on the east bank of the Nile River and is dedicated to the deities Mut, Khonsu, and Amun. Its construction was begun by Pharaoh Amenhotep III and was completed by Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Containing ten sections, Luxor Temple is massive.

Speciality about Luxor Temple⬇️

This is because Luxor Temple was the main venue for one the most important of ancient Egyptian religious celebrations, when the cult images of Amun, his wife Mut, and their son, the lunar god Khonsu, were taken from their temples in Karnak, and transported in a grand procession to Luxor Temple so they could visit the god that resides there, Amenemopet.
