I have lived in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Nagpur. Most of my childhood, especially my teenage years, was spent in Nagpur 🌆.

My parents live here, and every vacation starts in Nagpur 🏡.

One morning during the holidays, my brother (@vaaakya ) and I randomly decided to spend some time to connect 🤝.

Both of us live in different cities, and it had been a while since we had gone out. We got into the car and decided to go to Ramtek (a hilly town near Nagpur with small adventure parks, lakes, etc.) 🚗🏞️.

First Stop: We went to a bird park where they let us hand-feed, which was amazing 🐦🤲. Both of us have been huge pet fanatics and have had more than 8 pets in our childhood 🐾.

Second Stop: There was a small amusement park in the same place. This is us on the top of a weird yet fun Ferris wheel, riding it for the first time in maybe 5 years 🎡😄.

Third Stop: Further down the road, we found a great boating spot. The most memorable part was drinking Pepsi from a glass bottle (glass bottle flavor is always better, debate me) 🚣‍♂️🥤.

Fourth Stop: Days ahead, we visited our mom’s Kul devi temple in a place called Maihar, Madhya Pradesh. Our ropeway got stuck in between 🛤️🏯.

Fifth Stop: The last one here is the toy we built together. It was very random, but it might just be a great callback to the time when I used to play with Mechanix and open up RC cars 🛠️🚗.
