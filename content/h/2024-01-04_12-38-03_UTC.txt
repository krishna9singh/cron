Do you know 85% solo travelers are female, only 15% are male globally? And there maybe a reason whyâ€¦ 

I have been travelling solo for 3 years and I have met 3 main types of women:

Women who travel solo
Women who are afraid of travelling solo 
Women who arenâ€™t allowed to travel solo by their family 

This is so fundamental if think about it. Just for walking on the street without any fear or living our own life without hurting anyone, itâ€™s not easy for us, unlike the other gender. 

And thatâ€™s why we take solo travel personally. We demand our fundamental right to freedom, safety and personal growth. With all the responsibilities we handle from childhood, travel gives us a space to think of our own happiness and take a break. 

Tag your girl friends and ask them what they think ðŸ¤”
