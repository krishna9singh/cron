6 years of this incredible journey together for a lifetime..
How beautiful to be with you, no less than a dime..
To be with you felt like a beautiful rhyme..
All these wonderful years with a few sweets n some lime..

It must have been my greatest fortune that you came in my life..
And even greater fortune that you let me enter your heart..
To have you by my side, my life’s most memorable part..

Never did you let me feel alone when i suffered the most..
Whether i felt dead inside, you never let me feel lost..
Taking me by my hand one step at a time, you took charge of my post..
Without you I would never have come back, which I will forever n ever boast..

A very happy 6th anniversary to the greatest person in my life😊🤩😍
