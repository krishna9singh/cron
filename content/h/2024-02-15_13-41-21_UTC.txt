‚û°Ô∏èIconic train ride in Sri Lanka from Kandy to Ella

These are our tips:
Buy tickets in advance - it can easily happen that a few days before the train departs, all the tickets are sold out. Many people book these tickets several weeks in advance and tailor their entite itinerary in Sri Lanka to this ride. You can buy it online or at Kandy Train Station.
Prefer reserved wagons - if you buy a ticket for a reserved carriage, you can be sure that you will be seated and also that your carriage will no be overcrowded, as no one will be allowed in without a ticket.

Travel in 2nd or 3rd class - there is almost no difference between the second and third class. We don't recommend to travel in 1st class because it's not possible to open the window or door nor to move from them to another part of the train. In 2nd and 3rd class you can really enjoy the ride to the fullest with open window and local atmosphere.
Sit on right side (from Kandy to Ella) - if you have a specific seating choice, we recommend sitting on the right-hand side in the direction from Kandy to Ella. It is the side that offers the most beautiful views.

Enjoy freedom but be careful! The train is moving at a pretty slow speed, so it's not as dangerous as it seems at first glance. However, you need to be very careful because in some sections there are rocks and trees very close to the train.
