Some Good and affordable options are -
1. La Americana -Less Preservatives 
2. Bonn Multigrain Bread (but it does have artificial additives)
3. Britannia (but it does have artificial additives)
Consume them less -once or twice a week as they have artificial additives and some have refined palm oil too.

Best but abit Expensive Options are - 
1. Baker Dozen 
2. Paushtaa
3. The Health Factory (Recommended by Insta Family)
(Will update more breads in this list- do provide reference for healthy breads in comments) 

It would be best if you can make bread at home(process is very simple you can check YouTube videos).
