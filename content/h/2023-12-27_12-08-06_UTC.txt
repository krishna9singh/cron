Who would you want to go on a trip next year? 
- your partner 
- with a bachelorette party 
- or solo international üòç

This list is based on:
1. Couple places have good resort options so you can spend a good time indoors also or by the pool 
2. Bachelorette places have a really good party and nightlife 
3. Solo destinations have ample hostels and activities to socialise with others
