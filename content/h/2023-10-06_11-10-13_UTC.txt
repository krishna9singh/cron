From my perspective, white bread has several drawbacks. I emphasize the importance of whole grains for their nutritional value and fiber, oppose the high glycemic index of white bread, and prefer natural, minimally processed foods. I advocate for foods that support digestive health, are locally sourced and seasonal, and fit within cultural and traditional dietary practices. In summary, I encourage choosing whole grains and avoiding white bread for a balanced and holistic approach to nutrition.
