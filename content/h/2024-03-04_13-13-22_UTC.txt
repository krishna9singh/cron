2. Dr. Shrub’s oral conditioner 
3. Dr. Organic aloe Vera mouthwash 

Many commercial mouthwashes claim to eliminate 99.9% of bacteria with strong antimicrobial agents, but I’ve learned they can upset the balance of good and bad oral bacteria. Some contain alcohol in the form of ethanol, leading to increased mouth dryness and a negative impact on saliva. Synthetic additives like flavors are common too. Personally, I prefer the natural route, either trying options like fennel or cardamom or, like me, taking them after meals to not only freshen breath but also improve digestion.
