The recent trend involves making Maggi with vodka, but it’s essential to avoid consuming such combinations regularly. Maggi is a processed food with limited essential nutrients, and alcohol can hinder nutrient absorption, increasing the risk of nutrient deficiency. People tend to overeat while under the influence of alcohol, leading to higher calorie intake and potential weight gain. Therefore, it’s important to be cautious and mindful of such food experiments to maintain a balanced and healthy diet.
