Does Your HairOil contain Mineral Oil ❓

Mineral Oil is considered safe according to the FDA so yes these products are safe to use but I personally don’t prefer using this ingredient on our Hairs.

I want to clarify that I’m not against any brand itself, but I have concerns about this ingredient as pure oils prefer more health benefits.
I request that the brands takes this video in a positive way and make suitable changes in the product if possible.
