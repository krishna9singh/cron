If you’re taking creatine, it’s important to know that not all options are safe. An investigation in 2022 tested 175 creatine supplements on Amazon and found that only 8% were pure. Some supplements contained heavy metals and steroids. Wellcore Creatine is recommended due to passing these tests with over 99% purity and clean heavy metal results. It’s a high-quality option to invest in for your health. It costs ₹1100 and can last around 3 months.
