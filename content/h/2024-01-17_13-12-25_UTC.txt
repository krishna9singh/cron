I’ve learned some interesting things about the salt we commonly use. You see, table salt goes through a refining process involving high heat and chemicals, which strip away natural minerals, leaving mainly sodium. Excessive sodium intake can be harmful, so many companies are now producing low-sodium salt options.

However, I’ve discovered that refined products aren’t the best for our health. Instead, I recommend using Rock Salt or ‘Sendha Namak.’ It’s unrefined and packed with 83 essential micronutrients. According to Ayurveda, it not only enhances the taste of our food but also boosts our digestive system.

Table salt, on the other hand, contains artificial iodine. It’s actually better to get your iodine from natural food sources. If you still want to use iodized salt, it’s fine, but it’s a good idea to use it sparingly. In essence, making the switch to unrefined salt like Rock Salt is a healthier choice from my perspective .”
