👇 But why is it that you just CANNOT SINK in Dead Sea? Even if you don’t swim! 

Location: Dead Sea, Jordan 🇯🇴
(How to reach? Plan a trip to Jordan with your friends. You can see a one of the Seven Wonders of the World also here.)

The salt content of Dead Sea is really high. Hence it has a very high density which is more than the human body. You ll float in Dead Sea even if you don’t swim!

I am putting clay before entering the sea cause it covers any minor cuts on skin from the high salt content of the water
