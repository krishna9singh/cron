I made this video a year ago, and now you can see that the lines on this Teflon COATING have started to come off easily in food. But what happens if you eat it? Well, if you’re still using nonstick cookware from before 2013 or low-quality ones today, it may contain PFOA, which can be cancerous. Fortunately, newer cookware made after 2013 uses a different chemical that the FDA considers safe, but if you overheat it, you could still get sick from the fumes.

After 80 years of using PFOA, many people, including me, aren’t entirely convinced that this new chemical is much healthier. While it’s true that consuming small particles of clay or iron can have some benefits, in this case, there’s definitely no advantage and the risk of harm. Please consider sharing this video to spread awareness about this issue.
