Share & Plan Meghalaya now ‚û°Ô∏è

Why? Cause Lakshadweep is a very sensitive ecosystem. Over-tourism will do irreparable damage if the crowd floods there. 

Meghalaya on the other hand is experiencing the best season. You can see the clearest river of Asia- Dawki in its true form during Jan-Feb. You ll find waterfalls that won‚Äôt feel like anywhere else in India. Three-tiered waterfall, Rainbow waterfall, cleanest village of Asia üòç

<I hope the 2300 Indians who 
cancelled flights to Maldives 
do not end up in Lakshadweep. 
We have blue waters in other 
parts of India too. Do you know that the best season for Meghalaya is going on right now?>
