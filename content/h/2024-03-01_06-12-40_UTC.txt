You won't regret it 💯

I know a lot of my fellow travel friends on here would have had a moment where they have taken the risk to go solo travelling! Yes, It can be nerve-racking and it may take a lot of courage but you must try it out!🙏

I love solo travelling so much, I feel completely free to do whatever I want and whenever I want. I'm my own boss and I make my own decisions!👌

A great thing about solo travelling is also pushing yourself out of your comfort zone to speak to complete strangers a lot more and I can assure you this will lead to some great friendships!🫂

Tell me in the comments, have you tried solo travelling before? And to the people who have, what do you like most about it? 📱
