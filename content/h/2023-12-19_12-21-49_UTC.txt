INDIA passport is now stronger to travel💪
Roundtrip flight fares✈️

Save it for later📩

Visa on arrival is available for some countries but then free visa is a travellers dream. Its not about the fee but the warmth you feel for that country and ease of travel.

Check for flight prices for different dates and you can plan a trip as soon as you get a good deal. Ideally 20-30k for flight is perfect and then you can plan the budgets accordingly. South East Aisa is a good bet because cost of everything is almost like India.
