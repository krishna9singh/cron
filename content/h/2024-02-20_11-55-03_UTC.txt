Pidurangala Rock,Sri Lanka🇱🇰⬇️

The most famous place in Sigiriya is Lion’s rock. It’s a 200 m square-shaped rock where you have to climb more than 1200 steps to get there. The entrance fee is INR 1,200/-per person and it’s really overcrowded. The view up there is great, but you can’t see the place from that place right?

We recommend visiting Pidurangala Rock instead which is situated in the opposite side for the best view of Lion’s Rock. It’s very popular to go there for sunrise 😍The entrance fee is only INR 200/-per person and the view is priceless🥹🙏 It took us less than 20 minutes to get to the top where we enjoyed one of the best views in Sri Lanka.
