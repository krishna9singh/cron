This is a comparison video between the cheesy fries of one of the leading international fast food franchises in the world, i.e., Burger King and the cheesy fries of a local cafe in Delhi. Both these dishes were unique in their own way and loaded with lots of cheese. Surprisingly both the dishes tasted really good. I had a great experience trying out both the dishes. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
