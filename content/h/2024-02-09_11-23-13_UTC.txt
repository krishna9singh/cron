1. Footwear is important. No flip flops or open shoes for hiking long trips - Teva sandals or similar can be a great choice for hot weather hikes. But I still wouldn't wear open shoes for hiking even in very hot weather.👟☀️

2. Choose the right backpack for the trip. No need to carry a huge bag, if you could've managed with a smaller one. It is heavy to carry. Use the straps! Haha🎒💪

3.Do not forget a water bottle. Just do not haha. You can get many great ones that can contain 1L and are lightweight.💧😄

4.���It's really nice to have a fiber-towel that is light and dries super quickly and takes up no space. Definitely a must for me.🪩🛀

5.Buy small packing cubes to organize your stuff. It helps a lot when you have to find a shirt vs. a blouse - and then keep all your dirty laundry in one. Then you can quickly find and wash all your dirty clothes.🧳👕👚

6.Have a rain cover for your bag. You will probably need it.☔️

7.Have two credit cards and never leave them in the same place - then you will hopefully have one left if one gets stolen. Have a copy of your passport in case it gets stolen as well.💳🔒

8.Consider getting a Revolut card - there are no extra charges for using it abroad.💳🌏

9.When you have Wi-Fi - download the map of the city where you are in Google maps. Then when you wander around you'll always have a map that works; even when you don't have internet access.🗺️📲

10.Let no fear or practical reasons hold you back.Just do it! Everyone has had their first trip at some point and were just like you.✈️🌏😊
