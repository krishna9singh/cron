If you don’t want to put so much efforts, get cash in USD from a money exchange like @thomascookofficial + 2 existing cards that you already use. You will pay some extra fees but it’s an easy way to do a short trip.

🔸 Don’t get the cash from airport, get from your city ONLY!! 
🔸 Make sure your international transactions are turned on your cards
🔸Make sure that you inform your bank that you’re travelling abroad.
