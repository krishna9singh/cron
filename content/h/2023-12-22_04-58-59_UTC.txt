1:5 Rule

For every 1 trip you want to take, say no to 5 materialistic items. 
How?

People who prioritise travel say no to impulsive shopping, fast fashion, expensive alcohol, gourmet food orders, 100's of movies & dramas.
Why?

Cause we want to see new places, have new adventures, meet new people, see new cultures, eat different cuisines, learn new skills like communication skills,time management,problem solving.We collect memories, not things. A new watch never gave me the same happiness as a week of travel âœ¨
