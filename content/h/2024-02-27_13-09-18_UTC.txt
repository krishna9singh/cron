This is a comparison video between the most famous food items of India and America. While Americaâ€™s Most famous meal is Burger and French fries, Indiaâ€™s Most famous meal is chicken curry and rice. Both the dishes were unique in their own way and were extremely delicious and flavourful. I had a great experience trying out these food items. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
