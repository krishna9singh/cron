2. **Value of Education**: There is a strong emphasis on education within the community. Good education, especially in commerce and related fields, equips individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in business.

3. **Financial Prudence**: Members of the Baniya community are often taught the importance of thrift, saving, and prudent financial management from a young age, which are crucial skills for business success.

4. **Networks and Community Support**: Strong community networks offer support, resources, and business opportunities. The sense of community can also lead to partnerships and collaborative ventures.
