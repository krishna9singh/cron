This is a comparison video between the cheapest and the most expensive pizza of the world’s most famous pizza brand, Domino’s. The cheap pizza costed me ₹49, while the expensive gourmet pizza costed me ₹700. Surprisingly the quality of both these pizzas was really good and they tasted amazing. I had a great experience trying out these pizzas. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
