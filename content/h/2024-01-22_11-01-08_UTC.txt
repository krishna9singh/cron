This is the most important thing people miss when travelling. The timings of a place. They will research everything but forget that thereâ€™s a time limit on their itinerary. Itâ€™s unsafe and also poor planning. So either find out from online research or from people who have been there before. Else reach the destination in day time and ask other travelers / hotel guys / locals first.
