If you’re into soups, you’ve probably heard of Knorr soup – it’s delicious, but looking at its ingredients was quite a shock for me. Check this out: it contains Maida, starch, and sugar, all of which spike blood sugar and lack micronutrients. There’s a bit of veggies and some spices, but it also has hydrogenated palm oil, artificial flavor, and loads of sodium. Surprising, right?

But here’s the thing – it’s free of preservatives and has 100% real vegetables. Some ingredients are good, but as you can see, there’s more to it. So, if you’re just after the taste, go for it, but if you’re aiming for weight loss, better immunity, or overall health, I’d recommend making a healthy soup at home instead.
