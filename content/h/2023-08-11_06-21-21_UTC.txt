Why is sugar considered poison if it brings happiness? Well, think about it this way: if you consume anything excessively, even something delightful, it can have harmful effects. Sugar happens to be one of the most addictive substances, and overconsumption can lead to obesity and diabetes cases rising. So, consume it in moderation.
