Who all tried this?⬇️

This bright and juicy fruit became the country's symbol a long time ago. Poets and composers dedicated many poems and songs to it. Pomegranate represents love, abundance and immortality, which is the exact reason why it's considered as the King of Fruits in Azerbaijan.

Pomegranate juice can reduce macrophage oxidative stress, free radicals, and lipid peroxidation. Moreover, pomegranate fruit extract prevents cell growth and induces apoptosis, which can lead to its anticarcinogenic effects.
