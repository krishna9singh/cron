Maa SkandamataðŸ’•ðŸŒºSkanda is another name for Lord Kartikeya (Ma Parvatiâ€™s son and Lord Ganeshaâ€™s brother). Mata means mother and thus Skandamata means mother of Skanda or Kartikeya. As is clear from the name, she is another form of Ma Parvati.

In this form, Durga has four arms. She holds Kartikeya (Skanda) in one hand, holds a lotus in the second and the third hand and blesses her devotees with the fourth hand. She rides a lion.
