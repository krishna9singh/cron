Best Time To Climb Pidurangala Rock:

I opted for a sunrise hike up Pidurangala Rock to escape the heat and the crowds.

I suggest you do the same, as it gets scorching hot during the day.

I started my Pidurangala hike at 5:30 a.m. and made it to the top just in time to catch the sunrise.

Pidurangala Rock Hike Time:

Reaching the top of Pidurangala Rock takes 30 – 45 minutes, depending on your pace.

It’s not a difficult hike, and people of all ages and fitness levels will be able to get to the summit.

You’ll probably spend an hour at the top before hiking back down, which will take about 15 minutes.
