This is a mini food vlog and food review of all the different food items I tried during my recent visit to a Navratri Mela in Delhi. Surprisingly there were a wide variety of food items including, gol-gappe, papdi-chaat, kaathi-kebab & rumali roti, amritsari naan and roller kulfi. All these food items were prepared without using onion and garlic. I had a great experience trying out the food of this Navratri Mela. Hope you guys enjoy the video!
