“I’m concerned about the purity of honey available in India. It’s come to my attention that honey is often mixed with corn syrup. There’s a recommended test by FSSAI where pure honey should not dissolve completely when mixed with water; it should settle at the bottom. I’ve even tried this test myself and found that this test is not that reliable.

It’s disheartening to discover that many Indian companies are involved in honey adulteration. So, I would recommend buying honey from local sources that make it in small batches to ensure authenticity.

I think it’s crucial to be aware of the prevalence of honey adulteration in India and share this information to help others make informed choices.”
