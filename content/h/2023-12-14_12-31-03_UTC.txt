I’m comparing Amul butter to a Fat Spread that looks like butter. Amul butter is made from milk, while the Fat Spread is produced from refined palm oil, other vegetable oils, and a variety of chemicals.

To illustrate, I show how refined palm oil solidifies after hydrogenation, but the high heat used in the process destroys nutrients, making it less healthy. The Fat Spread is made in a similar way.

People often think the Fat Spread is healthy because it’s marketed as having lower cholesterol and saturated fat, along with added artificial vitamins. In contrast, Amul butter has more cholesterol and saturated fat but comes from milk, a source of healthy fats. It’s fine in moderation.

So, I advise against consuming Fat Spread, and I encourage sharing this information to spread awareness.
