Tokyo, how beautiful, how fabulous, how admirable, how majestic (words will fall short).
As my journey comes to an end in a few more hours, I admired this place, people and everything about this unknown world to me.
Despite extreme language barrier, less food options i felt i was in a place that welcomed me like their own and did not let me feel left out for even a second.

Made friends with whom I will share everlasting bonds. A frienship based on nothing but pure heart, trust and love.

Love you Tokyo & I will see you again soon 😊😊♥️♥️
