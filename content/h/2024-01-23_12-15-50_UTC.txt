Follow the 1:5 Rule
For every 1 trip you want to take, say no to 5 materialistic items. How?

People who prioritise travel say no to impulsive shopping, fast fashion, expensive alchohol, gourmet food orders, 100s of beauty products & makeup. Why?

Cause we want to see new places, have new adventures, meet new people, see new cultures, eat different cuisines, learn new skills like surfing and yoga. We collect memories, not things. A new pair of sunglasses or watch never gave me the same happiness as a week spent in Thailand.
