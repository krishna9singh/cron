Hello everyone, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you all about my current situation on Instagram. I regret to inform you that I haven't been active lately. My beloved cat is going through a tough time as he has a condition called entropion, which required surgery. Currently, he is admitted and undergoing treatment. Unfortunately, he's experiencing a lot of stress, and it has been challenging for me to focus on anything else.

I kindly request your prayers and positive thoughts for his speedy recovery. It would mean the world to me. Rest assured, as soon as things settle down and my cat's health improves, I will do my best to become active on Instagram once again.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this difficult time. I truly appreciate it.
