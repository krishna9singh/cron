ðŸš¨ Ethan Keiser, developed an app
called "Parallel Live" that simulates a fake live stream
experience, making users appear famous. The app
overlays an Instagram Live setup on the selfie camera,
creating the illusion of tens of thousands of viewers and
comments. #reelsinstagram

Keiser showcased the app in a viral video, demonstrating
how people treated him differently when they believed he
was famous. He tested the app's impact at a beach club
and a nightclub, where individuals became more friendly
and accommodating, even offering VIP treatment when
they thought he had a large online audience #aitools #ai #live #livestream #reels

Despite the app being released in 2020, it gained traction
recently after Keiser's videos went viral. The experiment
nighlighted how people react differently based or
perceived social status, offering users a taste of the
privileges associated with fame without actually
becoming famous #busypedia #busyfunda
