Driving in a new place might be stressful when making a quick decision near a flyover, and multiple turn alternatives might be confusing and cause accidents.

It will help people navigate confidently while approaching flyovers, junctions, and forks.

Junction View gives you a 3D view of flyovers, complicated intersections, and road forks that are coming up.

This function can help prevent car pileups in foggy situations, especially where traffic flows in a chain, as drivers will be warned about the impending fork, intersection, or obstacle in real-time.

The highlighted mark while travelling displays the exit or entry of the flyover in the 3D photo-realistic format. If accessible, the junction view displays a preview of the following junction.

By tapping the junction view arrow during navigation, one can close the shown intersection.
