BiryaniðŸ¥˜

This is a comparison video between the chicken biryanis of India and Pakistan. Chicken biryani is an extremely popular dish in both the countries and itâ€™s preparation is also unique in both India and Pakistan. Surprisingly both the biryaniâ€™s were very affordable, extremely delicious, flavourful and unique in their own way. I had a great experience trying out these food items. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
