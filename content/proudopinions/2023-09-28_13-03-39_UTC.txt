This is a mini food vlog and food review of my recent visit to Tom Uncle, which is one of Delhiâ€™s most famous Maggie point in Kamla nagar. Ironically I tried a variety of dishes like chilli potato, tandoori cheese pasta and Ramen, but I didnâ€™t try their Maggie. I had a great experience trying their food. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
