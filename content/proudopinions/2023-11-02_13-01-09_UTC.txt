This is a mini food vlog and food review of my recent visit to Pandit Ji Amritsari Kulcha in Pitampura, Delhi. I tried their Amritsari Naan thali for the first time and surprisingly, it tasted amazing. This thali was a fulfilling experience at a very affordable price. I had a great experience trying out the food of this local food joint. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
