This is a comparison video between authentic Chinese food and local Indian style Chinese food. I tried spring rolls and noodles which are the most popular Chinese dishes in India. Surprisingly both the local and authentic versions were unique in their own way and both were extremely flavourful and delicious. I had a great experience trying out these food items. Hope you guys enjoy the video !
